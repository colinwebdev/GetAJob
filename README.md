# Get A job - v 1.1

This is my first React-redux project, bear with me. 

## Concept
A personal dashboard for collecting and tracking job applications, with a double purpose of being a portfolio showpiece. 

## Progress
Starting - Technically my 3rd attempt, as I've refactored this project a few times over as I've learned more about React. It was getting unruly in just straight React so for this version I introduced Redux and Express, and brought in MongoDB.

2/22/24 - Back end skeleton set up with schemas, controllers, and routes for the major aspects of companies, listings and skills.
